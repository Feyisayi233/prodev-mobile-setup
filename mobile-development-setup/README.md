# 📱 Mobile Development Environment Setup

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this task is to set up and test a React Native mobile development environment using **Expo Go**. Expo Go allows developers to test React Native applications directly on physical devices without requiring heavy emulators or simulators.

---

## ✅ Requirements

Before setting up Expo Go, ensure the following tools are already installed:

- **Node.js (LTS version)**
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- **Compatible Operating System** (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
- **Expo Go** on your physical device (Android or iOS)

---

## 🚀 Why Expo Go?

Unlike traditional mobile development that requires emulators (resource-heavy and costly to maintain), Expo Go allows you to:

- Run your app directly on a **real device** (Android or iOS).
- Avoid dealing with multiple hardware requirements (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max).
- Save time with **instant testing** via QR code scanning.
- Develop and test seamlessly across platforms.
