# 📱 Mobile Development Environment Setup  

## 🎯 Objective  
The goal of this task is to set up and test a React Native mobile development environment using **Expo Go**. Expo Go allows developers to test React Native applications directly on physical devices without requiring heavy emulators or simulators.  

---

## ✅ Requirements  
Before setting up Expo Go, ensure the following tools are already installed:  
- **Node.js (LTS version)**  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
- **Compatible Operating System** (macOS, Linux, or Windows)  
- **Expo Go** on your physical device (Android or iOS)  

---

## 🚀 Why Expo Go?  
Unlike traditional mobile development that requires emulators (resource-heavy and costly to maintain), Expo Go allows you to:  
- Run your app directly on a **real device** (Android or iOS).  
- Avoid dealing with multiple hardware requirements (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max).  
- Save time with **instant testing** via QR code scanning.  
- Develop and test seamlessly across platforms.
